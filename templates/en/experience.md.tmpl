# Experience

<!--
  This file captures distilled lessons from development — not a changelog,
  but patterns that should influence future decisions.

  Each lesson records the gap between theory and reality.
  Keep entries short and actionable. The full causal trail behind a lesson
  (how it evolved, what was considered) belongs in knowledge/history/.

## Lessons

<!--
  Add a new section for each significant lesson.

  Always: Actually happened · Lesson · Source.

  Open with one of two, whichever fits:
    - "Theory said"  — there was a gap between what you expected and what happened
    - "How it hit"   — a procedural lesson with no gap ("I did this, and it saved
                       me"). Forcing "Theory said" here invents a fake expectation,
                       which is worse than an uneven format.

  Optional, and usually worth the space:
    - "Doesn't apply when" — the boundary. A lesson with no boundary gets
      over-applied, and you end up rewriting it once per context instead of
      sharpening it once.
    - "Related" — sideways links to sibling lessons. Which family a lesson belongs
      to is often more useful than the lesson.

  Source is the leg that goes missing first, especially once you start adapting
  this format. Drop it and the conclusion survives while the occasion that
  produced it doesn't — you can no longer rebuild the thinking behind it.

  Write the lesson as a *criterion*, not a *practice*. A practice ("split the
  binding layer from rendering and it becomes testable") expires with the stack;
  a criterion ("a measurer that changes what it measures isn't measuring it")
  travels. A lesson is finished when it changes how some criterion gets written —
  not when it has been written down.

  Lessons others commonly record (see if any hit something you've been through):
    1. Locate bugs with prints before reasoning about them
    2. On big refactors, let the compiler / type-checker be your to-do list
    3. Performance usually comes from the data model, not micro-optimization
    4. "Wrong → understand → fix" beats "think it through perfectly first"
    5. Don't skip TDD — "I'll add tests later" usually means 3× the debugging
-->

### [Lesson Title]

- **Theory said**: [What you expected based on design, principles, or assumptions]
- **Actually happened**: [What really occurred — be specific]
- **Resolved by**: [How the gap was bridged — the fix, workaround, or insight]
- **Lesson**: [One-sentence reusable criterion for next time]
- **Doesn't apply when**: [The boundary — where this stops being true. Optional, but it's what stops the lesson being over-applied]
- **Source**: [Link to history/ entry, episode, or PR/commit]

<!--
  Example:

  ### Verify before reimplementing

  - **Theory said**: The core module only handles evaluation, so we need
    to build a type checker from scratch.
  - **Actually happened**: After two days of building, discovered the core
    module already included full type checking — it just wasn't documented.
  - **Resolved by**: Deleted the duplicate implementation and documented
    the existing one.
  - **Lesson**: Always search existing code before building. The answer
    may already be there, undocumented.
  - **Source**: history/010-duplicate-checker.md

## Key Extensions

<!--
  This table is the "reading router" for /knowie-next and /knowie-judge.
  Core files hold only distilled lessons; the full causal trail lives in the
  history/ subdirectory. When a topic's keywords are triggered, the skill
  MUST read the matching sub-file before acting.
  Leave it empty at first; add a row whenever you move detail into a subdirectory.

| Trigger keywords | MUST read |
